# Team 21 - Sports Tournament Database

## Summary

Our project involves creating a sports tournament database that models how tournaments
are organized and recorded. The database records various details about tournaments, such as
formats, dates, and match results, and associated participants like teams, sponsors,
commentators, and broadcasters.
